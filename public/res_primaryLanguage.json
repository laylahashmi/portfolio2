      "description": "I'm a software engineer residing in the Dallas-FortWorth area. I have always been enchanted with the world of technology and innovaton and after graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington, I took the leap and transitioned from the healthcare industry to start my tech journey in late 2022. Fast forward to now, summer 2023, I have expanded my skillset by completing an advanced software engineering immersive where I gained valuable technical skills and development expertise. As a detail-oriented person, I have a passion for developing, designing and maintaining websites/applications with a focus on clean coding practices and user-friendliness. My goal is to continue learning and growing as a software engineer and to contribute to innovative and meaningful projects that make a positive impact on the world. In my free time, I love to read, paint, cook, hangout with friends/family and travel. My 5 year old cat, Luna, loves to sit with me while I'm coding and is my version of a programmer's rubber duck.",

Polling was leveraged to ensure data integrity and syncing between three databases linked to four microservices. I implemented form submission for client-side appointment scheduling and search/filter components to enhance user experience and increase website traffic. The sales management module is a user-friendly interface built using React, allowing dealerships to easily add and delete vehicle sales from the system, as well as keep track of all salesperson records.  Additionally, the application has a feature of VIP status, which is implemented for automobiles that have been serviced more than once.",

I wanted to include it because it was built from the ground up utilizing NextJS for the backend and React for the frontend. I also implemented Incremental Static Regeneration with Sanity.io which allowed me to easily update contents without needing to redeploy with each update. The UI design was thanks to my skills with Tailwind CSS and the animations were made with Framer Motion.",
