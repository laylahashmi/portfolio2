      "description": "I'm a software engineer residing in the Dallas-FortWorth area. I have always been enchanted with the world of technology and innovaton and after graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington, I took the leap and transitioned from the healthcare industry to start my tech journey in late 2022. Fast forward to now, summer 2023, I have expanded my skillset by completing an advanced software engineering immersive where I gained valuable technical skills and development expertise. As a detail-oriented person, I have a passion for developing, designing and maintaining websites/applications with a focus on clean coding practices and user-friendliness. My goal is to continue learning and growing as a software engineer and to contribute to innovative and meaningful projects that make a positive impact on the world. In my free time, I love to read, paint, cook, hangout with friends/family and travel. My 5 year old cat, Luna, loves to sit with me while I'm coding and is my version of a programmer's rubber duck.",
