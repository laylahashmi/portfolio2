      "description": "Hello! I'm a software engineer based in Dallas-Fort Worth who is captivated by the dynamic world of technology and innovation. After graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington, I leaped from finance to start my tech journey in mid-2022. Now, in winter 2023, I've honed my skills through a 5-month advanced software engineering immersive and a 12-week program as a Junior Java Developer Trainee with FDM. Detail-oriented and committed to clean coding, I specialize in developing user-friendly websites and applications. Beyond coding, I enjoy reading, painting, cooking, and exploring new places with friends and family. I usually have a coding companion, Luna, my 5-year-old cat who doubles as my programmer's rubber duck. Now, let's bring innovative ideas to life together! I'd love for you to check out my resume and send me an email.",

The sales management module is a user-friendly interface built using React, allowing dealerships to easily add and delete vehicle sales from the system, as well as keep track of all salesperson records.  Additionally, the application has a feature of VIP status, which is implemented for automobiles that have been serviced more than once.",
